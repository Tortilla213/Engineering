          As a group we have decided to improve the bridge by just encasing it with glue hoping nothing would happen.
          The project was a massive fail all of thinking sealing the spaghetti in glue with boba straws as the mold was
          a good idea but it was not. we have waited a whole weekend for the glue to dry and it hasn't. The main issue
          was that there was no air for the glue to dry. The first day of encasing in glue there was a leak but that was
          easily patched with tape. On the other hand our project suffered by not getting the actual treatment it needed
          is actually getting air. The glue made the spaghetti seemed cooked and stringy.
